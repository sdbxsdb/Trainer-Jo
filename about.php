        <h4>Who Am I?</h4>
        <p>My name is Jo and I'm a newly qualified Personal Trainer on a mission to be more and do more. It has taken me a long time to get here. A lot of blood, sweat, a few tears, and the support of those who know me best. <br><br> My fitness journey started around my final year of university. I say <cite>"journey"</cite> - I reluctantly joined the uni gym and was practically dragged to it several times a week.<br><br> After graduation, I joined my local gym (again, reluctantly) and constantly fought it and anything health or fitness related. Â I struggled with confidence issues in all aspects of my life - body confidence, my ability to achieve or do anything, and generally just not really feeling worth much. <br> I kept at it, and slowly but surely started to realise that those few nights a week spent in the gym were actually starting to make me feel a little bit better and I know it can be the same for you too.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The focused manual pressure and stretching used in myofascial release therapy loosen up restricted movement, leading indirectly to reduced pain. Many studies have found that massage, chiropractic manipulation and similar manual therapies work as well as other treatments for back pain.</p>

              <p class="card-text">An Exercise Referral is a specific and formalised programme whereby a medical professional refers a patient to a fitness programme, often based within the community. It is not the same as a 'recommendation' to exercise. A formal agreement will exist between the referrer and the exercise project.</p>
